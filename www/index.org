* Welcome to mu!

  With the /enormous/ amounts of e-mail many people gather and the importance of
  e-mail messages in our daily work-flow, it is very important to be able to
  quickly deal with all that - in particular, to instantly find that one
  important e-mail you need right now.

  For that, *mu* was created.  *mu* is a tool for dealing with e-mail messages
  stored in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir][Maildir]]-format, on Unix-like systems. *mu*'s main purpose is to
  help you to find the messages you need, quickly; in addition, it allows you to
  view messages, extract attachments, create new maildirs, ... See the [[file:cheatsheet.org][mu
  cheatsheet]] for some examples. Mu's source code is available [[https://github.com/djcb/mu][in github]], and
  there is the [[http://groups.google.com/group/mu-discuss][mu-discuss]] mailing list.

  *mu* includes an emacs-based e-mail client (=mu4e=), a simple GUI (=mug=) and
  bindings for the Guile/Scheme programming language.

** Features

   - fast indexing for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir][Maildir]], Maildir+ and Maildir-on-VFAT
   - search for messages based on the sender, receiver, subject, date-range,
     size, priority, words in message, flags (signed, encrypted, new, replied,
     has-attachment,...), message-id, maildir, tags, attachment (name,
     mime-type, text) and more
   - support for encrypted and signed messages
   - command-line tools for indexing, searching, viewing, adding/removing
     messages, extracting attachments, exporting/searching address lists,
     creating maildirs, ...
   - accent/case normalization - so /angstrom/  matches /Ångström/
   - can be integrated with other e-mail clients such as [[http://www.mutt.org/][mutt]] and [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WanderLust][Wanderlust]].
   - [[file:mu4e.html][mu4e]], an emacs-based e-mail client based on =mu= (see screenshot).
   - [[file:mu-guile.html][mu-guile]]: [[http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][guile 2.0]] bindings that allow for scripting, advanced processing
     of your data, and doing all kinds of statistics
